These are from http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/cdrkit.git/tree/?id=763f5bd6c288397a0157afa91b8bd0c4b6019d47
to use external libcdio-paranoia instead of internal cdparanoia wrt http://bugs.gentoo.org/206939
cdrkit-1.1.11-paranoiacdda.patch was modified to use upstream location of headers cdda.h and paranoia.h
because Fedora is moving them to location of old libcdio for some reason
