This is the place where I store all ebuilds which are

  - modified by me
  - new and not in portage yet
  - already removed from portage but I still need them

Some packages have ChangeLog files, others don't; depends on my laziness :)

Why so many _pre packages? Well most packages aren't really pre-versions. It's 
just much easier to recognize that gentoo finally has newer versions of those 
packages in portage when I use the _pre-tag in the versionnumber.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Most _pre ebuilds (and some non-_pre, too) are using an eclass I have written to 
reduce the amount of changes I have to do to an ebuild. So most of the ebuilds 
ONLY work properly if you download the poly-c_ebuilds.eclass as well and put it
into the eclass-folder of your portage-overlay. 
!!! IMPORTANT !!!


You can access the portage-overlay directory via:

  HTTP:
    http://www.gentoofan.org/gentoo/poly-c_overlay/

  RSYNC:
    rsync://rsync.gentoofan.org/poly-c
      (this is no official rsync-mirror. Do NOT "emerge --sync" to this server!!)

  LAYMAN (You have to install app-portage/layman to use this method):
    layman -a poly-c


All ebuilds are tested on ~amd64 and ~x86 installations. As I have no other 
arch I can't tell if an ebuild works on those architectures as well. 

Poly-C
