This is the place where I store all ebuilds which are

  - modified by me
  - new and not in portage yet
  - already removed from portage but I still need them

Why so many _pre packages? Well most packages aren't really pre-versions. It's 
just much easier to recognize that gentoo finally has newer versions of those 
packages in portage when I use the _pre-tag in the versionnumber.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Most _pre ebuilds (and some non-_pre, too) are using an eclass I have written to 
reduce the amount of changes I have to do to an ebuild. So most of the ebuilds 
ONLY work properly if you download the poly-c_ebuilds.eclass as well and put it
into the eclass-folder of your portage-overlay. 
!!! IMPORTANT !!!


You can access the portage-overlay directory via:

  PORTAGE:
    Drop the poly-c.conf file into /etc/portage/repos.conf/ dir and run:
    emaint sync -r poly-c

  HTTPS:
    https://www.gentoofan.org/gentoo/poly-c_overlay/

  RSYNC:
    rsync://rsync.gentoofan.org/poly-c
      (this is no official rsync-mirror. Do NOT "emerge --sync" to this server!!)

  LAYMAN (deprecated):
    layman -a poly-c
      (You have to install app-portage/layman to use this method)

All ebuilds are tested on ~amd64 and ~x86 installations. As I have no other 
arch I can't tell if an ebuild works on those architectures as well. 

I got several requests to provide this overlay via git or another VCS. The
reasoning varied between "having secure access to the overlay" and "being able
to track changes in the overlay". These are valid reasons but I won't start
using a VCS because it would simply disturb my daily work flow. So please bear
with the rsync protocol until I might change my mind and habits.
